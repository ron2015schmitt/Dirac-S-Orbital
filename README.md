# Dirac-S-Orbital
Calculates the bilinear covariants / local fields of the relativistic electron in a Hydrogen atom

An interesting differences between the Schrodinger (non-relativistic) and Dirac (relativistic, more accurate) results:
+ The Dirac Equation more accurate predicts the electron energy: -13.59847 eV. (Matches value listed in Table 3.3 of Ohlsson, Tommy. Relativistic quantum physics: from advanced quantum mechanics to introductory quantum field theory. Cambridge University Press, 2011.)
+ The Dirac equation predicts a non-zero velocity field that circulates about the spin axis so as to create a angular momemntum and magnetic field that cancels the intrinsic spin field (Lenz Law in classical electrodynamics).
