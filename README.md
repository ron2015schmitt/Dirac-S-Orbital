# Dirac-S-Orbital
Calculates the bilinear covariants / local fields of the relativistic electron in a Hydrogen atom

An interesting differences between the Schrodinger (non-relativistic) and Dirac (relativistic, more accurate) results:
+ The Dirac Equation more accurate predicts the electron energy
+ The Dirac equation predicts a non-zero velocity field that circulates about the spin axis so as to create a angular momemntum and magnetic field that cancels the intrinsic spin field (Lenz Law in classical electrodynamics).
